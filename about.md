My name is Cameron Holiman and I love making things. I work as a software developer and enjoy playing my SNES and Switch, making and drinking snobby coffee, watching Twitch, making props and hiking in my spare time.

I'm [@mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid) on GitHub

I also have a [Coffee Snob Sicker app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coffee-snob-stickers/id1154238768) for iMessage if stickers are your thing.
