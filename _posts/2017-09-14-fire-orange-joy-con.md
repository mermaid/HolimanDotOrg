I’ve always loved the [Funtastic Nintendo 64 consoles](http://nintendo64.wikia.com/wiki/Funtastic_Color_Series). The console of my childhood was gray, but that controller man… Atomic Purple.

Once I saw that you could get clear ones from Amazon and AliExpress, I was sold. And from having a hobby making and collecting props, I knew just how to color them.

Things you’ll need:
- [Clear replacement Joy-Con housings](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07527NNBG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=holimandotorg-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07527NNBG&linkId=2c675c7f9fde1bcd1484ad05f1abf719)
 - [iDye Poly with Color Intensifier](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EYK21UY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=holimandotorg-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00EYK21UY&linkId=8e235289620d76fb8104da960faaea68) in the color of your choosing (other dyes meant for polyester/plastic may also work. YMMV)
 - A pot big enough to hold the Joy-Con housings in a small vat of dye
 - A thermometer
 - A pair of tongs to fish the Joy-Con out of the boiling dye vat

The basic principle to dying plastics (or most anything) is that you need a dye that can be absorbed into the plastic (RIT is my go to for dying most things, but it only really dyes natural fibers, so we need a dye meant for plastics/synthetic polymers. iDye Poly works great for this) and heat. For maximum dye absorption (and therefor brightness) you want to heat up the water/dye combo to as hot as the plastic can take without melting/warping. After a few minutes, you take them out and dunk them in cold water to “seal” in the dye. You can then repeat a few more time for max color.

Lets do this.

The Joy-Con are made out of ABS, which has no true melting/softening point, but according to Wikipedia, it’s generally usable up to 178°F/80°C. So heat up your water near there (I used ~160°F/70°C)

I experimented first with the middle plastic piece that holds the battery inside the Joy-Con. I wanted to make sure the dye would work and the temperature wasn’t too hot before making the plunge. 

I suggest you do this, because I definitely had the water too hot. The piece warped pretty badly. Becaues of this I just used the gray part one from the original. The only downside I see from this is that the little piece of plastic in between the triggers and bumpers is still gray, but you can barely tell.

So here is what I did:
 - heat up some water to 160°F/70°C
 - add in some dye (probably only some of it, i used about half for the whole pot) and color intensifier
 - let it sit for ~5 minutes (agitate/stir it frequently)
 - use tongs to pull the parts out of the dye and put it into cold water
 - repeat dye baths until you reach the color you’re wanting

Done! That was simple!

Now just take apart a set of Joy-Con and replace the parts (iFixit has a pretty good guide)
*Caution:* It’s the devil

P.S. I also make a YouTube video documenting this experiment
